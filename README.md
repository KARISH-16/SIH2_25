Smart Communication Aid 🗣️🤝

Problem Statement

Communication barriers—due to language, dialect, hearing impairments, or accessibility challenges—make it difficult for people to interact seamlessly with society, digital services, and emergency systems. This results in delayed support, exclusion, and lack of inclusivity.

The challenge is to build a smart, web-based communication platform that uses AI, multilingual support, and assistive features to bridge these gaps and ensure inclusive, real-time, and reliable communication.
